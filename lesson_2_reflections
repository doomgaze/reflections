Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
When you initialize a repository with 'git init' - git creates a .git file which is hidden
from the average user. This file is needed because it contains a bunch of metadata about the 
history of the repository (commits, changes, etc) since it was created.
