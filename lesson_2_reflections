Question:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Answer:
When you initialize a repository with 'git init' - git creates a .git file which is hidden
from the average user. This file is needed because it contains a bunch of metadata about the 
history of the repository (commits, changes, etc) since it was created.

Question:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do
you think it offers?

Answer:
The staging area is different from both the working directory and the repository by being the
intermediary for them both. It allows for you to add commits to a pool 
'working directory --> staging area' and if you're satisfied with your work, you can commit it 
from the 'staging area --> repository'.

The value it offers, the way I understand and see it right now is that it's almost like an area
where you are commited to pushing these changes but haven't fully commited yet.
